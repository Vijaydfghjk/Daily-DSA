You need to determine if a password is accepted or rejected based on how many users have already registered with the same password. If a password has been used more than k times, it should be rejected; otherwise, it should be accepted.

passwords := []string{"password1", "password1", "password1"}
k := 2

package main

import "fmt"

func getRegistrationStatus(passwords []string, k int) []string {

	pwd := make(map[string]int)
	temp := []string{}
	for _, v := range passwords {

		pwd[v]++

		if pwd[v] > k {

			temp = append(temp, "REJECT")
		} else {
			temp = append(temp, "ACCEPT")
		}

	}

	return temp
}

func main() {

	passwords := []string{"password1", "password1", "password1"}
	get := getRegistrationStatus(passwords, 2)
	fmt.Println(get)
}
